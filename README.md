# SSH-Remote-Server-Connection

Created multiple Ec2 servers on AWS

Created one of the server as the Main server, Copied the .pem file from the local and created the .pem file in the Main server inside the .ssh directory.

Created "server_list.conf" file, Inside that we kept multiple IP's of remote server.
